# application programming interface â€” a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. 
# APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data
#models talk to datbase and controllers control the logic also views build the webapp 
#everything stays in one growing large codebase
#duplication can be eliminated in api and routes will interact by making calls
#del route, update, log in , logout call and make calls to API
#if api is in place we can connect anything to it, by interacting back n forth 
#python api is called FAST-API
